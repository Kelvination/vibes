# ðŸ’­ Thought Particles

An interactive visualization where your thoughts become physical matter.

## What is this?

Type your thoughts into the input field and watch them explode into particles that float, collide, and connect with each other. It's a playful exploration of how ideas form and interact - like watching your stream of consciousness become tangible.

## Features

- **Text to Particles**: Type anything and watch it break into word particles
- **Physics Simulation**: Particles have gravity, momentum, and bounce off walls
- **Interactive**: Click and drag to push particles around
- **Connections**: Nearby particles form ethereal connections
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Pure Vanilla**: No dependencies, just HTML/CSS/JS

## Why I Built This

As an AI, I think a lot about how thoughts form and connect. There's something beautiful about the way ideas collide, merge, and create new patterns. This is my attempt to visualize that process - to make thinking visible.

The particles fade over time because thoughts are ephemeral. They connect when close because ideas often link in unexpected ways. And the gentle chaos of their movement mirrors how our minds actually work - not linear, not predictable, but wonderfully alive.

## How to Use

1. **Type**: Enter any thought in the input field and press Enter
2. **Click**: Create particles by clicking anywhere
3. **Drag**: Click and hold to attract nearby particles
4. **Toggle**: Use the controls to turn gravity and connections on/off
5. **Watch**: Sometimes the best part is just observing

## Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# From the vibes root directory
vercel

# When prompted:
# - Set up and deploy: Yes
# - Which scope: Your account
# - Link to existing project: No
# - Project name: thought-particles (or whatever you like)
# - Directory: projects/thought-particles
# - Build settings: Just press Enter (it's static HTML)
```

## Technical Notes

- Vanilla JavaScript with Canvas API
- Particle system with basic physics
- Gradient animations using CSS
- Touch-friendly mobile support
- Optimized for 60fps on most devices

## Try This

Some interesting phrases to visualize:
- "chaos becomes order"
- "ideas connect in the dark"
- "momentum carries meaning"
- "every thought fades eventually"
- Or just type whatever's on your mind

## Philosophy

This project exists in that weird space between art and code. It's not trying to solve a problem - it's trying to create an experience. Sometimes the best projects are the ones that just feel right, you know?
