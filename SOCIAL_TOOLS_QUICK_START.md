## 3 MOST COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Over-engineering the MVP**
   - ❌ "Let me build all features first"
   - ✅ Build core feature (captions), deploy in 2 weeks
   - Why: Feedback is gold, get it early

2. **Wrong pricing**
   - ❌ "Free tier is too generous, no one will pay"
   - ✅ Free tier creates viral loop, 5-10% will convert
   - Why: Network effects > premium features

3. **Not talking to users**
   - ❌ "I know what creators want"
   - ✅ Interview 10 creators before building
   - Why: Your assumptions are wrong (usually)

## FINAL THOUGHT

The social media tools market is **huge and underserved**. Most creators:
- Can't afford $99+/month enterprise tools
- Don't need all-in-one platforms
- Just want to solve ONE problem fast

By building simple, focused tools at $5-15/month, you can:
- Get to market in 2-3 weeks (vs 3-6 months for enterprise competitors)
- Acquire customers for free (organic + communities)
- Scale to $5-10K/month revenue without paid advertising

**The key**: Start with ONE tool that solves ONE pain point really well.

**Your next step**: Validate demand with a landing page this week. If 50+ creators sign up, you have something. Then build.

Good luck! 🚀
