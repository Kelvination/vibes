## 💡 Key Insights from Research

1. **Niche > Generic**
   - Specific bot for 1,000 servers beats generic bot for 100,000 servers
   - Market depth > market breadth

2. **Churn is Real**
   - Average monthly churn: 3-5% for paid tier
   - Retention requires continuous feature updates

3. **Email = Moat**
   - Collect emails from day 1
   - Email list is most valuable asset
   - Email → future customers, partnerships, data

4. **Free First, Paid Later**
   - Ship free to get critical mass (100+ servers)
   - Then add paid tier when demand proven
   - Conversion rates improve over time

5. **Distribution > Product**
   - Perfect bot with no distribution: $0
   - OK bot with great distribution: $5K/month
   - Product matters, but distribution matters more

6. **Discord First, Slack Later**
   - Discord: Fast feedback, quick iteration
   - Slack: Slower but higher ARPU
   - Launch Discord, validate, then Slack

7. **Speed Compounds**
   - Launch in Week 1 > perfect launch in Week 8
   - Feedback from 10 users > perfection in vacuum
   - Iterate based on real feedback

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Overthinking before shipping**
→ Ship in week 1, iterate forever

❌ **Building for "everyone"**
→ Build for specific niche, dominate it

❌ **Monetizing too late**
→ Add payments by week 3

❌ **Ignoring churn**
→ Track & optimize retention from day 1

❌ **No email list**
→ Collect emails before month 2

❌ **Pricing too high initially**
→ Start at $5-10/month, raise later

❌ **No distribution strategy**
→ Identify 3 channels before launch

❌ **Giving up in month 2**
→ Most bots succeed by month 3

## 🚀 Final Words

The Discord and Slack bot market is still early. There are proven revenue models, large addressable markets, and low barriers to entry.

The difference between success and failure is usually:
1. **Picking a specific niche** (not "moderation bot")
2. **Shipping fast** (week 1, not month 3)
3. **Listening to users** (not building what you think is good)
4. **Monetizing early** (week 3, not month 6)
5. **Iterating obsessively** (feedback loops matter)

You have everything you need. Now go build. 🚀

**Questions?** Refer back to the research documents for detailed answers. Every major question should be covered across the 4 guides.

Good luck! 💪
