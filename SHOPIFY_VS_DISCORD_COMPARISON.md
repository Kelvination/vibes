## Revenue Trajectory Comparison

### Discord Bot (TokenWatch - Crypto Alerts)
```
Month 1-3:  $0/month
Month 4-6:  $100-500/month (early adoption)
Month 7-12: $2,000-5,000/month (word of mouth)
Year 2:     $10,000-20,000/month (established)
Year 3:     $20,000+/month (mature product)

Path to $100K/month: Need 2,000-5,000 servers × $20-30/month
Timeline: 2-3 years
```

### Shopify App (StockMaster - Inventory Sync)
```
Month 1-3:  $0/month
Month 4-6:  $500-1,500/month (early POD adopters)
Month 7-12: $2,500-4,000/month (growing awareness)
Year 2:     $8,000-12,000/month (market leader)
Year 3:     $20,000+/month (network effects)

Timeline: 2.5-3.5 years
```

## Hybrid Strategy: Build Both

### The Winning Approach
If you have time, build BOTH platforms targeting the same problem:

**Example: Inventory Management**

**Discord Bot** (Community-focused):
- Help dropshipping/POD communities manage inventory
- Free tier with alerts
- Premium tier for analytics
- Revenue: $2-5K/month

**Shopify App** (Merchant-focused):
- Help dropshipping/POD stores with supplier sync
- Integration with Printful, Shopify inventory
- Advanced forecasting
- Revenue: $10-20K/month

**Combined Revenue:** $12-25K/month

**Why it works:**
- Discord bot drives awareness
- Bot users who open stores become Shopify app customers
- Shopify app customers often mention in Discord communities
- Network effect: one platform promotes the other

## Financial Reality: Best Case Scenarios

### Best Case: Discord Bot (Top 1% Performer)

## Conclusion

**Discord bots** = Faster money, bigger risk, harder to scale beyond niche
**Shopify apps** = Slower to start, higher revenue, more sustainable

**For the vibes monorepo specifically:** You could build a bot + app combo in the same project folder, reusing core logic between them.
