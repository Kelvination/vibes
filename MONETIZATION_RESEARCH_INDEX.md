4. **Higher customer value** - Merchants pay $15-50/month, communities pay $5-10
5. **Better retention** - Business customers stay 8-12 months vs communities churn in 3-6 months

## Key Takeaways

1. **Shopify apps earn 3-5x more per customer than Discord bots** ($20-30/mo vs $5-10/mo)
2. **But Discord bots reach market 2-3 weeks faster** (viral growth)
3. **The sweet spot:** Build a niche Shopify app for $5K-30K/year revenue in 18-24 months
4. **Real money:** A single successful app can hit $100K+/year if you nail the niche
5. **Execution matters more than idea** - Good execution on mediocre idea beats great idea with no follow-through
6. **Start small:** Pick ONE problem, solve it brilliantly, scale later
7. **Market to your people:** Dropshippers, POD stores, fashion brands - know your customer type
